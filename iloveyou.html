            <h2>ILOVEYOU</h2>
            <p>ILOVEYOU was one of the first viruses that really hit millions of Windows users through an email and it was at a time when emails were still in its infancy so the idea that an email would cause your computer to destroy any files was thought of impossible. There were previous email worms but this one also copied itself to all the contacts in the Windows Address Book which increased it's spread.  </p>
