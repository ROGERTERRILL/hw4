    <h2>ILOVEYOU</h2>
    <p>
      ILOVEYOU was one of the first viruses that really hit millions of Windows
      users through an email and it was at a time when emails were still in its
      infancy so the idea that an email would cause your computer to destroy any
      files was thought of impossible. There were previous email worms but this
      one also copied itself to all the contacts in the Windows Address Book
      which increased it's spread.
