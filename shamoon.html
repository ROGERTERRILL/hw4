            <h2>Shamoon</h2>
            <p>Shamoon is a lesser known but what could have possibly been the worst virus ever that could have nearly crippled the worlds economy. In 2012, computer admins for Saudi Aramco discovered a virus that said it would destroy computers at a certain
                time but the adminstrator ignored it. When the time came, many computer systems were whiped and ultimatly, one of the biggest producers of oil had to disconnect from the internet and manually ship out barrels of oil without it's electronic
                infrastructure. It nearly brought the worlds economy to a grinding halt.</p>
